        <h2>Tasks</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Valhav, where shadows dance upon once-vibrant streets. Aye, Adventurer, our town wasn't always like this. It was once a place of joy, laughter, and bustling life, where merchant's calls echoed and children's giggles filled the air. But now, a darkness we call the Fold, born of some evil power, shrouds our once resplendant home.

            Many moons have passed since the Fold draped itself over our rooftops, leaving our souls restless and our skies in a state of eternal gloom. The townsfolk whisper of eerie phenomena and everlasting chilling murmurs and screeches. Now, you stand at our gates, marked by fate, I know. Could you be the Light Bringer the prophet babbled about in his last breath? The harbinger of hope destined to bring light back to our streets and restore our town to its former vibrance?
            
            Will you answer our silent plea and embark on a quest to cast off the Fold and free Valhav from its suffocating grip?
